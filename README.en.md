# logseq-plugin-reminder

System notification for Scheduled and Deadline.

## Feature Highlights

- Support Logseq's builtin `Scheduled` and `Deadline`.
- Support the repeater on `Scheduled` and `Deadline`.
- No notification will be received for `Scheduled` and `Deadline` that has no time set.
- Support for reminding again when clicked on the notification.

## Note

For technical reasons, there may be a delay of ~1 minute in reminding if Logseq is left in the background for a long time. It is recommended to not depend only on this plugin for reminding important events, and that the alert time be set to a few minutes earlier.
